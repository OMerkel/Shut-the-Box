This is the famous traditional pub game Shut the Box.

Shut the Box is played in different variants and no organization is known
targeting standardization of rule variants for the game. Thus if
playing <em>Shut the Box</em> with others you should first try
to find agreement and commitment on rules. If in doubt I recommend
to prefer and apply the locally played rules.

The Shut the Box application is intended to be less restrictive.
Such that no specific rules are really forced to be applied. At any
time you can take back an action like open a just closed flap and
perform a different choice. If in need you can use a single die
or two dice, roll again, switch to the menu and look up any rule
variants in between game play as described in the application itself.

This way different variants and rules with a recommended variant
are available and explained accessible via the menu in upper left:

* Variant _Single Die on flaps #7, #8, #9 closed_,
* Variant _Avoid High Sums_, e.g. suitable for younger players,
* Variant _More Restrictive Single Die_,
* Variant _Two Dice Only_,
* Variant _Exact Match_,
* Variant _Score Single Die is Enough_,
* Variant _Thai Style_,
* Variant _Multiple Fixed Rounds_,
* Variant _Defined Maximum Penalty_,
* Variant _Flap Numbers Are Penalty Digits_
