This is the famous traditional pub game Shut the Box. It is implemented for HTML5/Javascript/CSS platforms.

Shut the Box is played in different variants and no organization is known
targeting standardization of rule variants for the game. Thus if
playing <em>Shut the Box</em> with others you should first try
to find agreement and commitment on rules. If in doubt I recommend
to prefer and apply the locally played rules.

The Shut the Box application is intended to be less restrictive.
Such that no specific rules are really forced to be applied. At any
time you can take back an action like open a just closed flap and
perform a different choice. If in need you can use a single die
or two dice, roll again, switch to the menu and look up any rule
variants in between game play.
